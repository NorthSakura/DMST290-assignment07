## Original Fonts
- Arial
- Roboto Slab
- Inter
- Helvetica

## Newly Picked Fonts

- Grenze Gotisch for titles
  - Grenze Gotisch has more modern design compares to Arial, which can attract more attention if the title use this font.
  - Grenze Gotisch is not only modern but also human, contains a lot of dramatic details, and more interesting to look at.

- Orbitron for navigation
  - Orbitron is more grometric and also has a feeling of sci-fi, which is more attractive than Helvetica.
  - Also Orbitron can better cooperate with other graphics and logos, which is also suitable here.
- Cabin for body
  - Since the website is about introducing a city, therefore I think there should be more humanist sans which can provide reader with a feeling of comfort.
