# Assignment 1: Hello World
Plain and simple, no need to rock the boat.

## Interesting Features
- All of the content is blatantly stolen from Wikipedia
- A leaflet.js map added, featuring a thrilling view of Rochester
- A rather nice (in my biased opinion) usage of CSS grid, including
  - Media query handling of smaller screens
  - Smooth transitions from centered column to right-skewed with a left gutter (to hold a nav I never switched over)
