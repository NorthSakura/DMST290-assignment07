# Assignment 1: Hello World
Plain and simple, no need to rock the boat.

## Interesting Features
- All of the content is blatantly stolen from Wikipedia
- A leaflet.js map added, featuring a thrilling view of Rochester
- A rather nice (in my biased opinion) usage of CSS grid, including
  - Media query handling of smaller screens
  - Smooth transitions from centered column to right-skewed with a left gutter (to hold a nav I never switched over)
- Everyone's favorite feature to hate: smooth scrolling

## Updates from Duncan
1. I changed the font, font color, as well as the background color. I did this for partially because I thought it looked better, but I also wanted to improve the contrast between the background and the text for better readability.
2. I rouned the corners of images. I just think this looks nicer.
3. I made the nav bar sticky so that wherever you are in your reading you can easily jump to a new spot.
